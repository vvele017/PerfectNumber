  Description:  Go through numbers from MIN range to MAX range and 
  find the perfect numbers. Perfect numbers will be found if the number
  is equal to its sum of divisors.

If the number is perfect, display 2 square roots:

1. Use the build in C function for square root
2. Find the square root with the babylonian square root

Find the babylonian square root by:
1. Set the perfect number as the initial guess
2. continue calculating a new guess until accuracy is achieved

Print out the square root result and the iterations it took to get this result

Display the amount of iterations it took to find the babylonian square root.           
        Input:  No input.
  
       Output:  The perfect numbers from MIN to MAX range 
       will bre printed along with their proper divisors. The expected square root    
  
     Process:  Loop through the MIN and MAX
                During the loop, check if the number is perfect by storing its 
                proper divisors and adding them together. Compare this sum with
                the number. If equal, return the perfect number. If it isn't equal, return 0.

                if the current number from the loop is perfect, calculate its square root
                with the regular c function, and print.

                Then calculate using the babylonian method. Set the perfect number
                as the initial guess and keep updating initial guess until we get
               the accuracy we want.    
  
   Required Features Not Included:  
                1. Methods are not efficient.
                2. Babylonian square root calculated incorrectly

    Known Bugs:  None
